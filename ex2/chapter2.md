# Chapter 2

One night, Taohong gets a phone from Mingyue.

“Will you go to my home and have dinner?”

“OK, when the time will I go to your home?”

“About 9 o’clock in evening, is it OK?”

“Of course, wait me, please, I’ll come after half hour!” (Now the time is 8 o’clock in the evening)

“Do you want to let me pick you up?”

“No, thank you. I’ll go by the taxi.”

“OK, wait for you!”

“Toot…” The phone hangs up.

One hour later…

“Ding-dong.” The doorbell is ringing.

They are playing and having the dinner…

Two hours later…

“Do you want to let me send you to your home?”

“No, thank you.”

“That’s all right, let me send you!”

“Ah, OK!”

Taohong is following Mingyue and go to -3 floor to get on the car.
“Well? You changed your car again, yes?”

“Yes, I changed it.”

“I remember that the original car is ~~half value of Lamborghini~~, yes?”

“Yes, I changed it to a Hongqi H9.”

“Ah, the car you sold got more than that, right?”

“I bought another car.”

After they get on the car, Mingyue drive out the community, then they drive to Qingtai Avenue.

“Well, why does he come here again?” Says Mingyue.
