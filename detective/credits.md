# Postscripts
This novel, Mingyue’s detective notes, has officially finished, thanks for all the readers’ company! At here, we got many sufferings, but we still came here. When I was writing the theme called Nucleus, I couldn’t really continue to write, each chapter was racking my brains to leave readers with better text, the author is going to crash!

Let’s review each theme. The first one is Team H, the second is Nucleus, the third is Missing Case of Xie He, the fourth is Murder Case in Lanman Town. These four cases have accompanied everyone to the end.

Eventually, thanks for everyone!

This way has been walked to the end!
