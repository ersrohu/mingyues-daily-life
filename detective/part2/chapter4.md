# The Investigation Group

Next day, the President tells the President of Fuzekistani that in fact, the investigation group around him is the suspects.

“Ah?! That’s impossible! They are a group of people who I trust them, they’re impossible to betray me!”

“Ah, this…”

The President hangs up the phone.

“What shall we do now, Mingyue?”

“We couldn’t convince him then we shouldn’t give attention to him, this is his country, whether he to do or don’t do is his case, because we’ve already finished the cases which are we should have done.”

“That’s OK.”

Now the investigation group are playing video games and goofing off.

## Author’s word
This theme was made by a reader who provided the ideas to me and let me write this, I can only say so that I haven’t much knowledge of nuclear science, so I just end this up hurriedly.

I believe that there must be some readers want to make complaints for that I wrote this too nonsensically, it can only say so that the author hasn’t the knowledge, ah! I’ll read more books and gain more knowledge. Or else the readers will start to make complaints again.

Next theme preview: a missing case of a person.
