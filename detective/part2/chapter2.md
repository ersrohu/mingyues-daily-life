# The Milk

Although Mingyue doubts, he may just doubt after all, so he doesn’t do anything.

One time, Mingyue smells a strange smell which is like uranium-235.[^1]

“The odor is smelling like the uranium-235,” thinks Mingyue, he wants to talk about this with other one, but there is quiet and there isn’t anyone, but why is there uranium in the hotel lobby? Mingyue take his Geiger counter and to detect the radioactive matter. There is a box of Yili® Pure Milk which emits a lot of radiation[^2], although it doesn’t exceed the standard.

Mingyue puts his glove on and touch it softly, then he has been burnt the hand a bit. Luckily, there aren’t any problems. However, at this time, the investigation group have gone already back the hotel. Mingyue put the box of milk into his item sample bag which is carried anywhere by him.

“What’s the matter? What have you done?”

“Nothing, just put a box away of pure milk.”

“Take it here, it must be checked by us.”

Mingyue doesn’t disagree  to do it, then he takes the sample to them, but which is a fake sample, when he takes it to them, they look very happy, we don’t know why.

Mingyue thinks, “It seems that I know who the suspect is.”

Mingyue smiles evilly…

## Footnotes

[^1]: The author didn’t know that the uranium hasn’t odor. In addition, the theme of “nuclear” was put forward by me, he hasn’t very much knowledge to the nuclear science, so just as a novel for pleasure, don’t be a too earnest person – note from translator.

[^2]: The author told me that the radioactive matter wasn’t permeated into the milk, there is some powder of the radioactive matter on a face of the milk box, that powder was put on it by one who was wearing gloves and he touched it, so the powder kept here – note from translator.
