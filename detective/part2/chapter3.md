# Suspect: the Evil Smile

We don’t know why, it seems that Mingyue has ideas in his brain, and he thinks that he can crack the case with these ideas.

“But where is the nuclear fuel rods?” Mingyue stops thinking suddenly, he is stuck, there aren’t any ideas were made. “I can never ask them!”

“Oh, there is that box of milk!” Mingyue take out the item sample bag and take out his Geiger counter.

“The uranium-235 is still remained on it. It needs to be sent to the sample inspection station. But they may be at there,” thinks Mingyue. “No, I have to go back my country secretly.”

Next month, Mingyue drives foreign car to go back his country while they are not attention on him. Mingyue looks at the calendar, today is 13th August.

On 19th August, Mingyue arrives the motherland.

Mingyue gets off the car, looks at sky and sighs deeply, then he walks to the government.

“Why do you come back?” The President is surprised to see Mingyue.

“I’ve already known a lot, please tell the President of Fuzekistan that I needn’t to investigate this case?”

“Ah?!” The President gets more surprised.

“You can let somebody to tell their President that I’ve already known who the suspect is.” Mingyue answers, then he lets everyone at this place get surprised. “Don’t talk a lot, the ‘Investigation Group’ is the suspect group. Look at this box of milk, it’s the sample.”

“Can you identify the suspect with only a bottle of milk? You are too hasty!” A leader is doubting the Mingyue’s skill.

“Yes!”

“That’s right!” The leaders among here are discussing this.

“If you don’t believe it, you can verify this yourself.” Says Mingyue, then he turns back and go.

All of the leaders don’t believe it, only one leader takes away the sample, however, they are eaten humble pie, with force.

In the night, the President visits Mingyue.

“Where are the nuclear fuel rods which you said it?”

“The photos are changed by the investigation group with Photoshop. I found a friend and let him recovery the changed photos. They said that they would buy the nuclear fuel rods, it is just a gimmick, they want to let me don’t doubt them, and let them keep hiding.”

“You are our country’s pride!” Says the President.

“You flatter me! Just talk with their President.”

“OK, we will go tomorrow, goodbye!”

“Goodbye!”
