# The Colleague

Mingyue finds that there is a mark on the colleague’s arm, unintentionally.

“What? Could it be… ‘Team H’?!” After Mingyue greeting the colleague in a hurry, then he drives to the prison.

“Hello, prison guard. Is Taohong at here yet?”

“Yes, she is. Let me take you to see her.”

“No, thanks. I just want to know that.”

Then Mingyue leave here with car. However, he doesn’t go back the police station, he goes home.

“I can’t stay at this police station continually, but the case has to be investigated as usual.” Mingyue has already been aware that around the police station hasn’t already been normal again.

After he’s home but he’s still thinking a question: where has that missing person gone? Then Mingyue open the household registration information database and searches “Xie He”, but he gets surprised.

“What? The died person has respawned?!” Mingyue feels that is extremely strange. In fact, the information of Xie He in the household registration information database in the computer at Mingyue’s home is completely different than the household registration information database in the computer at the police station. “I think that someone has changed the important files in the computer at the police station, deliberately.”

A few moments later, Mingyue finds the position of Xie He’s home with some software and goes once.

When he arrived Xie He’s home, but he sees that Xie He is sitting on the sofa stably.

“Who do you want to visit, Mingyue?” Xie He is welcoming Mingyue politely.

“Ah, nothing. I just want to ask something to you.” Says Mingyue and he comes in, then he takes out a photo, he says, “Whose photo is this?”

“This person, uh, who is this? Uh, I seem don’t know him.”

“OK, I’ve to go back quickly, bye-bye.” 

“Bye!”

## Author’s word

Hmm, this theme, *the Case of Missing Xie He*, ends up here. It seems that the author has written too many irrelated things.

Next case preview: a case of murder.
