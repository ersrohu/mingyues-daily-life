# Xie He

“What’s your name, please?”

“I’m Haotian.”

“Have you seen this person?” Says Mingyue then he takes out a photo. “This person is Xie He, he has been missing for some days, suddenly. Have you seen any person who like this?”

“No, I haven’t”

“OK, thank you! Thank you for your cooperation, let’s go to the gate and take a photo for you, OK?” Mingyue says very politely.

“Of course.” Haotian’s expression is very calm, but his heart feels strange.

After taking photo, Mingyue send Haotian home, then he comes back the police station in a hurry.

It’s afternoon now, the colleagues have already come back the office.

Mingyue opens the household registration information database in computer, then he uploads the photos. But Mingyue finds that he has 96% similarity to Xie He. Then he looks all, he only has 37% similarity to Haotian.

“That’s not very correct, everyone know that Haotian lie to me. However, he’s already known that he will be carried, but he still wanted to do this, isn’t this a gift for free?” Mingyue feels very doubtful.

By this time, Zhang Beihai run into here, “Mingyue, here are your letters!”

“OK, thank you!” Says Mingyue.

When Zhang Beihai leaves, he smiles slightly.
