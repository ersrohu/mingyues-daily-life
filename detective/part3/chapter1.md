# River

Mingyue walks to a riverside.

“Ah, the river in autumn, there are a lot of fallen leaves, what a sad view!” Mingyue sighs. “No, why do I think about the sadness? Ho-ho, how beautiful this view of autumn is!”

Now, Mingyue sees the most famous beggar around this city, Buluo. He plays the violin very well.

On the next day, Mingyue gets a phone. The person who phoned Mingyue says that there is a corpse was found on Xinzhan River.

“What? A corpse?” Mingyue run to the Xinzhan River, then he sees that the policemen are collecting the samples.

“Mingyue, you have come.”

“Don’t take most things, stop now first.”

It’s midday now, and it’s silent around.

“Where’s the corpse?”

“The corpse might be washed into the larger river, that’s only a corpse, just be found by someone.”

“Are there any photos?”

“Yes, there are.”

The policeman lets Mingyue look at the photos, Mingyue doesn’t say anything, just the expression is very strange, he looks not very good.

Mingyue look around nearby, there aren’t any suspicious samples and suspicious people.

Mingyue lets the policeman send the photos to him. After, Mingyue send these photos to his friend who helped Mingyue to process images before. A few moments later, his friend replies to him.

“It seems that this image hasn’t the trace of be photoshopped, but the part of the corpse is like be photoshopped, unfortunately, it really wasn’t photoshopped.”

“OK, thank you a lot!”

“No, it’s a pleasure!”

Then Mingyue hangs the phone up.

Mingyue has not ideas yet. Wait, who is the corpse? What’s the relationship with them?

Mingyue run back the police station at once, boots computer and open the household registration information searching system.

“Well, according to the face, is this person…Xie He? Why do I think that he has a relationship with Xie Xun?” Mingyue searches it, he finds that they are a pair of cousins! But in the household registration information searching system, it doesn’t show he is deceased, the head portrait doesn’t turn gray, it means that he is alive yet. But he matches many another people, only Xie He has 87% similarity to him. In additional, there also is a person who has 2% similarity to him but who is deceased yet.

“But there isn’t any blood in the image, and it was taken at 10 o’clock in the morning.

“But there were many people in the park. And it’s a major case the news will not de-report, however, is Xie He really deceased? …” Now Mingyue gets a phone.

“Mr Mingyue, it seems that I’ve seen Xie He! He is at the Qingtai Avenue .”

“What? OK, I’ll get there soon. Please watch him and don’t let him get away!”

“Of course.”

Mingyue hangs the phone and drives the car to the Qingtai Avenue immediately. He gets to Qingtai Avenue and phones to the stranger who phoned Mingyue just now.

“Do you get here yet?”

“Yes, I do.”

“He’s already ran to the Jingfeng Road!”
