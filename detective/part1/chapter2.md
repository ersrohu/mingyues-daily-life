# Interrogation

“Well, come here.” Says Mingyue and he takes the suspect to the interrogation room.

“Name? Male or female? How old? When did you start taking drugs? How long time that you taking drugs? … please answer these really, else at your own risk.”

“My name is Xie Xun, male, 32 years old, I started taking drugs when I was 30 years old, I have taken the drugs for two years… these things are the total that I know.”

“Well, we will meet at the court some days later!”

This night Mingyue sleeps very worriedly, his brain is reverberating this sentence, “I’ll let you regret lifelong!” This is the threat from Xie Xun when Mingyue was arresting him.

In the night, Mingyue gets up and drives to police station. He walks to the archive room fast, then he starts finding to the identity file of Xie Xun.

“Well, that’s odd. Why does the file show that he is 32 years old, but it seems that he is in his forties? No!” Says Mingyue then he searches the profile of Xie Xun on the Internet. “No, this profile was changed deliberately by someone—this head portrait is fuzzy, but other people’s head portrait are clear, I think that there is a spy in the police station!”

Some days later, Mingyue meets Xie Xun at the court.

“We open a court session now!” Says the judge out.

A long time later, the judge declares, “Now Xie Xun is sentenced to two years, after release then he has to go into the drug rehab, and detox fully.”

“OK.” Xie Xun answered, but Mingyue feels odd.

“Since there’s a spy in the police station who has been bought by Xie Xun and who must be an important person.” Thinks Mingyue.

“We can’t discuss this thing all police station, anyway, else we will let the person hide deeper. Just investigate it first, let me see what I can find.”
