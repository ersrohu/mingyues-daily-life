# The Mastermind

Mingyue gets out from Lingxiao’s home, but he’s seen an evil smile from Taohong.

“Um? That’s odd, Taohong expression, could she be the mastermind of this…?” Says Mingyue then he goes to the police station fast.

Mingyue gets to the police station, he boots his computer first, and he looks very nervous. (Mingyue’s colleague’s Inner OS: what’s the matter of Mingyue, he went out and back recently.) Then Mingyue open the household registration information database and searches it, it shows that there aren’t any reasons to show that there are any connections between Taohong and this case.

“Could she really not be…?” Mingyue is speechless.

“Oh no!” Mingyue seems to think something and phones Taoping (Mingyue’s wife).

“Hello, Taoping, did Taohong post on WeChat Moments recently? If she did, please send the photos to me.”

“OK, please wait.”

A few moments later, Mingyue gets the photos from his wife. As expected, there is a mark on Taohong’s shoulder.

“Well! As expected, is still as expected, the mark lays bare her.”

Sure, Mingyue saw unintentionally that both the police station chief and Xie Xun have the mark like this, therefore, Mingyue thinks that this case wasn’t made by one person, it was made by a team.

“What’s name of this team?” Thinks Mingyue, he remembers suddenly a method from *Detective Chinatown 3*. He thinks himself, “H!”

After, Mingyue hellos Taohong with an identity of a stranger, “Hey, H!”

After a lot of trials, Taohong has been put in the prison, and Xie Xun has been put in the heavy prison. About the ex-police-station-chief, he has been dismissed, and he has been put in the heavy prison, too.

When Taohong is put in the prison, she still makes an evil smile, again.
