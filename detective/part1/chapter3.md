# Investigation

Today, Mingyue is working usually at the police station. He boots the computer skillfully and open the Microsoft® Edge to see the news. Suddenly, a bar of news goes into his eye.

“Well? Xie Xun was arrested and into the prison because he takes drugs, his father…this bar of news talking about the thing of yesterday?” Says Mingyue, then he clicks it curiously, “Xie Xun was arrested and into the prison for two years, after release then he has to go into the drug rehab, his father says that he must find the person who arrested his son and let him get infinite pain!” “Oh, that’s, oh… I can’t explain it!” Mingyue thinks that it may be only possible, but Xie Xun must be arrested and gone into the prison! It’s very normal. 

Suddenly, he sees an image which is not very normal, he says, “Um? Why does the Xie Xun’s father seem like our police chief?!” Mingyue gets much doubt, then he opens the household registration information database and search the police chief, “Well, he is like Xie Xun’s father, really.” Says Mingyue, but he persuades himself in the mind, “There are lots of people who look the same around the world, this may be just a coincide, I must stop this thinking.”

But in the night Mingyue opens the household registration information database and searches it. However, if he doesn’t check then he doesn’t know, then he gets shocked when he checks—Mingyue find that Xie Xun’s father and the police chief are twins… Suddenly, Mingyue’s computer is hacked and gets the virus, then it shuts down automatically, and Mingyue cannot boot it.

“It seems that the thing starts turning to complex.” Thinks Mingyue.

On the next day, Mingyue drives to the prison first and inspects the situation of Xie Xun.

“Please accept the security check.” Says the security checker and he let Mingyue stop, “Please show me the driver license…”

After everything, Mingyue gets a piece of information which lets Mingyue gets surprised: Xie Xun ran away from the prison Mingyue thinks that the police chief help Xie Xun ran away, because only police chief came here recently. A few moments later, Mingyue gets into the office quickly, he thinks that the police chief will declare the thing about Xie Xun ran away in front of everyone, however, it’s very quiet in the office.

Then Mingyue boots the computer, he finds that the virus disappeared. He opens the household registration information database and searches again, then he finds that the relationship between Xie Xun’s father and police chief was changed to two strangers.

“But all the evidence is connecting to the police chief, he is the suspect,” Says Mingyue. “But there is a clue which lets me get confused…” In fact, the police chief’s mother was Mingyue’s father’s good friend then, normally, the relationship between them is good. But the police chief’s mother is a drug addict, when Mingyue’s father knew this thing then he got angry, because he hates anyone who takes drug very much, then Mingyue’s father broke off the relation between him and the police chief’s mother.

“According to the common sense, it…” Suddenly, a phone breaks Mingyue’s thinking.

“Mingyue, would you like to play at my home?” Says Lingxiao in the phone.

“Of course. Anyway, I can’t reason it now. Let me go, please wait for me!” Then Mingyue hangs the phone up.

Mingyue gets to Lingxiao’s apartment complex, but the elevator can’t move. Suddenly, the speaker in the elevator says, “Hello, gentleman, please release Xie Xun from the prison, and declare to everyone, yourself is the drug addict, Xie Xun is only a scapegoat! Else, ho-ho, your son will go to die.” Then the elevator gets normal.

But when Mingyue gets to the Lingxiao’s home, the door closed slightly. When he come in then he finds that the home is very messy, Lingxiao’s family hide themselves into the big closet and they are very frightened. When Mingyue open the door of the closet…
