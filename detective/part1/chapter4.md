# Implication

When Mingyue open the door of the closet, Lingxiao’s family get frightened and shriek.

“Please be calm, I’m Mingyue, not terrorist!”

“Oh! Mingyue!”

“Uncle Mingyue!”

“Brother-in-law!”

A few moments later, Lingxiao’s family are calm, they tell Mingyue what happened just now.

“Just now, there were two people, no, three people…” Says Taohong with straight eyes.

“Let me tell you!” Says, Lingxiao. “There were three terrorists came to our home and robbed our home, they let us get into the closet, else they will exterminate us. Then, my wife came home just now, and she was robbed by the terrorist, when I think that… oh…” When Lingxiao is talking he seems to think something, “Oh, wife, alarm now!”

“No, thanks, I’m afraid that I will implicate you in this thing, but don’t worry, I disconnect you, and don’t contact me. Else, I’m afraid that you will be implicated by this, don’t contact each other.”

“Ooh, it seems that Mingyue analyzes it well!” Thinks Taohong.

“I must leave now, I think that we cannot contact each other until this case ends, bye!” Says Mingyue and he opens the door to leave. However, when he is leaving, he turns back, then he sees an evil smile made by Taohong.
