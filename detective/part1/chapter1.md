# Having meal

Today, we don’t know what Mingyue wants to do, he wants to have a meal with Lingxiao, it’s not normal.

“Have you got any cases today?” Lingxiao is in doubt, “You usually hasn’t any free time when you have got cases, why do you want to have a meal with me?”

“Just nothing. I want to do something by the way.” Says Mingyue mysteriously, it seems that Mingyue has something, “OK, forget it, please don’t ask it again, let’s go to the Seafood Restaurant and have the meal! I’ll wait for you, bye!”

Then Mingyue hangs the phone up. (Lingxiao’s Inner OS: Why do we have meal at a far place? Oh my gosh!)

They arrived the restaurant just now. Mingyue doesn’t have any new behaviors, just like having meal normally. However, when he is having the meal, he looks around, we don’t know what he will do.

A few moments later, Mingyue take on a bag of methamphetamine from his briefcase, then he smashes it on the floor, and that makes a big noise.

We don’t know why—a waiter is attracted here. He looks around, when he determines it’s safe around, he starts talking with Mingyue.

“Gentleman, can you sell me this bag of crystal meth cheaply?”

“Of course! You can see my briefcase, there’s a lot of crystal meth!”

The waiter sees his briefcase with doubt, but he sees a pair of silver-gray handcuffs—he makes a reaction quickly—the person in front of him is a policeman!

When the waiter wants to get away from here, Mingyue arrest him and handcuffs his hands quickly, and Mingyue says, “I’ve already arrested you, don’t struggle!” (Lingxiao’s Inner OS: I’m very surprised!) Then Mingyue takes the suspect and Lingxiao to police station.

“Thank you very much, Lingxiao.”

“No problem. When I was looking at you were arresting the suspect, I got very surprised.”

“This is a basic behavior you shouldn’t be surprised. Well, I will investigate him.”
