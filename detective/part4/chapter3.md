# Buluo

Mingyue rides on the shared bicycle again, then go to the Government of this town.

When he gets there, he’s been stopped by the doorman, “What do you want to do at there? Haven’t you seen it? Governmental staff only!” The doorman rebukes Mingyue loudly.

Mingyue takes off the mask then say, “I want to search some archive and get some information.”

“Just come in!”

Mingyue walks in, he is not unhappy. In the government, although here is a little town, the decorations are very luxury, not like a little town. Mingyue walks to the archives room and finds the data. Suddenly, Mingyue finds an odd archive: Buluo?!

“Isn’t he the most famous beggar in Xitai? Why can his data appear in the archives of deputy town mayors? This case looks a bit mysterious.” Mingyue starts to read this odd archive.

A few moments later, Mingyue has known. Buluo was the deputy town mayor of this little town before, however, because of an event, he’s been dismissed by the Organization Department. After this event the town mayor felt that others can’t be relied, so there is no person to take the office. Suddenly, Mingyue sees a piece of application text, there is a red and big cross on it.

> For the previous event, I’m very guilty, and I have already engaged in very deep introspection. Please tell the Minister of Organization Department, I apply to take the office of the deputy town mayor. Hope it can be passed.

> Buluo the Ex-Deputy-Town-Mayor

Next to this, there’s a piece of paper under it.

> You’ve made a heinous crime, and all the people of town don’t forgive you!

This kind of scrawls must have written by the town mayor, personally.

Suddenly, Mingyue finds that there are many letters in the garbage can, and that are teared, they are absolutely sent to the town mayor by Buluo. “Well, could it be that Buluo let somebody kill the town mayor? Because Buluo got impulsive then he killed the town mayor.” Mingyue thinks, and goes to the office of the town mayor’s secretary. Sure enough, Buluo asks the secretary to take the office of deputy town mayor.

Mingyue goes out the Government, but there is a doubt: why did each victim of this case die under a fluorescent lamp, is this a signal or implicature?
