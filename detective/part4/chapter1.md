# Fluorescent tube

This is a dark and windy night.

Mingyue gets a secret message, in a town, the mayor of this town died. And the other side says that Mingyue can never let police know this, because this case will impact whole town.

A few moments later, Mingyue packs luggage and gets on the train, then gets on the bus. On the next day, Mingyue arrives that town.

“I’ve arrived here. Where is the crime scene?”

“You wait for me at the village entrance, I will take you to there!” The answer from the messages let Mingyue think that is very unpleasant.

A few moments later, a woman waves to Mingyue then Mingyue walks to her.

“Let’s go and see the crime scene.”

“OK.”

Mingyue and the woman go straight a block of villa that seems good, and they go to the floor two.

Floor 2 is still using the original simple decorations: a long old-fashioned fluorescent tube lies on the sofa. Maybe because it’s very old, it’s stopped producing sparks and hissing, the deceased next to it may be the mayor of this town.

“Do whatever you should do, I must go to buy the casket.”

“OK.”

Just these simple sentences. Mingyue certainly doubts the woman, with the doubt before, is she already to be arrested? “I can’t solve this case and determine the murder lightly, because the clues are seriously inadequacy now.” Mingyue thinks.

The woman goes downstairs with da-da sound. It’s dusk now, due to there aren’t any lights, it starts becoming dark around. When he is looking at the pool of blood, he gets cold back.

The injured part of the mayor is very strange, as can be seen that the abdomen has scars produced by firearms, but here aren’t any bullet casings. It illustrates that when the deceased was at home, he didn’t know that the killer was next to him. However, there is a question: how did the killer kill the deceased? Here isn’t any trace, except – a fluorescent tube? This kind of normal fluorescent tubes can electrocute one, however, the pool of blood over the floor can’t be explained. According to this, the deceased was killed by the killer with the firearms, but what is the relationship to the lamp?

It’s evening now, here is very dark because there isn’t light.

Mingyue feels that is hard to investigate in the evening, then he leaves quickly.

On the next day, Mingyue gets some more shocking information…
