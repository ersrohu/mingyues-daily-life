# Mistaken Solution

After Mingyue has known that those people have been killed by Buluo, then he drives back to the Xitai City.

Mingyue walks to Xinzhan Riverside, he sees Buluo, and he wants to follow Buluo to his home. According to the people, on each day, after he prays, he will go to the most luxury villa complex in this city. But after Mingyue followed, he finds that Buluo lives in a same block of villa with a person! This is not strange, many people said that he disappeared as soon as he arrived at the villa complex, and because he was a deputy town mayor before, he was rich and bought a villa is a very normal thing.

On the next day, Mingyue follows Buluo and goes to his home.

“You, what’s the matter?”

“Buluo? I’ve long-awaited!” Mingyue takes off the mask while he is saying.

“Ming…Mingyue! Uh…you, what’s the…matter with…you?”

“I just come here and visit you.”

Mingyue sits on the sofa, and waves to Buluo to sit down and talk with him.

“Did you hear of the deaths of several people in Lanman Town recently?” Says Mingyue and he smiles evilly suddenly.

“Ah, yeah? I never heard it! What’s the matter?” Buluo feels anxious suddenly, and he is caught off guard on the question from Mingyue.

“Are you sure that you never heard it?”

“Ah…ah this…, indeed…never…heard it…yeah?” Buluo’s body starts trembling.

“What’s the matter, do you feel cold?” Mingyue circled Buluo’s neck with backhand, and pull him here, then say, “Are you sure?”

The atmosphere starts getting heavier now.

“Yes! I’m sure! I never heard it!!! Don’t ask of this again! You can’t ask me! Don’t you know?” Suddenly, Buluo’s attitude gets abnormally firm.

“Is that you go to surrender yourself or let me take you to litigate? I suggest you to surrender yourself, maybe the judge will give you a suspended sentence!” Mingyue cuts to the chase directly.

“Don’t put the blame on me! Why do I know this thing?!”

“We will meet each other on the court! That’s your choice, you must never regret it!” Says Mingyue, then he stands up and leaves.

By this time, the spring wind blows off the peach blossoms. Under that peach tree, there is an orange cat, it’s lying on there silently.

Mingyue looks and looks at the orange cat, he sighs, “Buluo is same to this orange cat, they don’t know the seriousness of the situation, completely. They are hard to solve!”

Mingyue walks to there and hugs up the orange cat. The orange cat instead follows Mingyue obediently and goes to his home…
