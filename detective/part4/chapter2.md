# The Little Town

On the next day, Mingyue gets the phone from the husband of that woman. By the phone, it can be heard that the husband of the woman is very alarmed, he doesn’t know how to do for a while. By the time, Mingyue doesn’t know how to solve, but the most primary thing is to find the next victim, otherwise, this case will become trickier. As for why it is tricky, I believe that each reader has already known – yes, because that woman died.

But even if he connects all the clues, he can’t find who is the next victim.

“There is no evidence now, unable to determine who is the killer. I can only go to there and extract some samples for analysis.” Then Mingyue finds a shared bicycle on the road and rents it with a software on his phone.

Mingyue rides to an empty place that is near that woman’s home. He stops the bicycle and pay, then he goes straight that woman’s home.

What shocks him is that the woman’s cause of death is completely same to the mayor – she was also shot with the firearms to the abdomen, then because of excessive bleeding to died. But what lets Mingyue feel doubt is that both their places of death were next to a fluorescent tube that was sparking and hissing. It explains when the deceased is dying, the fluorescent tube was repairing, this let the killer grasp a good killing place thereby shot to kill.

“The most important thing is to find the next victim, but the little town is big, there are 70 thousand people, how to find?” As he is confusing, he remembers suddenly that both of first two victims relate to the leaders of this town. “Then the next target should be the Deputy Town Mayor.”
