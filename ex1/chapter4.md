# Chapter 4

Mingyue takes on the menu and let Taohong and Lingxiao look.

“Order yourselves.”

“OK. Let me see it.” Says Lingxiao.

They order flavorful beef, fried shredded potatoes, and more dishes for chaffy dish, temporarily.

“Well, these vegetarian dish and meaty dish are good.”

“Uh, yeah, I think that is delicious, too, we can go there for a meal next time!”

The chaffy dish has color, fragrance, and flavor, when one sees it then who wants to eat it. Three people come to it, that’s good!

“More bottom material!” Says Taohong.

“OK!” Says Mingyue.

“Let me tell the waitress and change the chaffy dish to double-flavor chaffy dish.” Says Mingyue, then he goes and tell waitress. (Taohong Inner OS: Does Mingyue want to use our money to pay? A normal chaffy dish needs 86 *yuan*[^1], a double-flavor chaffy dish is 169 *yuan*[^2] ! Well, it’s so horror!)

Taohong ask Lingxiao with doubt, “Lingxiao, is Mingyue reliable? I think that he wants to let me pay! We seem to order dishes for altogether about 400 *yuan*[^3] !”

“No, he is reliable. He isn’t this style. I had a lot of meals with him, but he never lets me to pay, all were he to pay, when I want to pay for him, he didn’t let me pay it, he ‘grabbed’ it.”

“Ooh…”

Mingyue come in now. Behind Mingyue follow a waitress. The waitress changes the chaffy dish skilled: She put the double-flavored chaffy dish on the table first, then she takes off the normal chaffy dish, and put it on the serving cart, then she takes the double-flavored chaffy dish to the groove on the center of table, finally, she pushes the serving cart and go out the door.

“I’m sorry, I let you wait for a long time.” Says Mingyue, he looks guilty.

“That’s all right. But I want to eat a dish.” Says Taohong with a questioning attitude.

“What do you want to order?”

“I want to order the combo for 2000 *yuan*[^4].” asks Taohong with a questioning attitude.

“Of course! However, can you finish it?” says Mingyue and he lets everyone get shocked. (Taohong Inner OS: Is this 2000-*yuan* thing deserved to evaluate as this?! I won’t buy it easily, although I can buy it!)

“Well, I pack it now and I’ll eat it in the evening.” Taohong thought how to cope it.

“OK. It’s not late if you’ll pack it in the evening.” Mingyue seems not very surprised for 2000 *yuan*.

“But it’s so far if I’ll come here in the evening.”

“Are you full? If you’re all full then I’ll go to pay.” Says Mingyue. (Lingxiao’s Inner OS: I’m like an outsider.)

“No, we are not, please wait.” Says Taohong.

Five minutes later, Mingyue go to the checkout counter and pay.

“Hello! Well, did you come here together?” Says cashier.

“Oh, yes, we did. Let I pay for you.” Says Mingyue. (Taohong’s Inner OS: wow, he can pay for me really! But it looks very expensive.)

“A total of 562 *yuan*[^5] , how do you pay?”

“I use WeChat to pay, thanks.”

“Please scan the QR Code.”

“Beep! Pay successfully!” Says cashier, “Thank you for your patronage, welcome to visit next time.”

“Just help me to checkout a 2000-*yuan* combo, thanks.”

When they finished everything… (In fact, the author doesn’t want to write them.)

“Bye-bye!”

“Bye-bye!”

“Bye-bye!”
