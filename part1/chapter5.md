“Some days later is Taohong’s birthday, what can I get her for a present?”, says Mingyue, “Let me phone Lingxiao and ask him.”

“Hey, Lingxiao Some days later is Taohong’s birthday, what will you get her for a present?”

“I think that we can give her a large meal, that’s enough.”

“Well. Can Taohong drive any car? I want to know it.”

“Yes, she can. What’s the matter?”

“Has she got a car?”

“No, she hasn’t. What’s the matter?”

“Oh, nothing. I just want to know it.” (Lingxiao’s Inner OS: How can it be nothing, it sounds that he wants to present a car.)

“OK, bye!”

“Bye!”
