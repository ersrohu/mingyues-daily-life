# Chapter 7

At the night of Taohong’s birthday, both Mingyue and Lingxiao come to here together. However, there’s a question which lets Mingyue feel annoyed. Because Lingxiao invite Taohong to have meal, but the restaurant is not near the Guicheng Community, however, they want to have meal at West Loop Road Restaurant.

When Mingyue know that they want to have the meal at there then he phones to 4S shop. But there’s luck in misfortune which is the 4S shop didn’t deliver the car to near the Guicheng Community, and the restaurant is at near the 4S shop, maybe just some kilometers.

“Is the waiter? I want to change the address.”

“Of course! Where do you want to change?”

“I want to change the address to West Loop Road Restaurant.”

“That’s OK, I tell them to deliver the car to there! Won’t you change the address again?”

“Yes, I won’t change it, that’s it.”

“OK, bye.”

“Toot…” The phone hangs up.

“Yeah, let’s go!” While Mingyue is observing that Taohong is talking with Lingxiao, he is thinking, “When the Taohong finish the meal, she will be very happy, and there’s a new car, that’s perfect!”

“The dish comes, it’s the lemon duck. Enjoy the meal!” The waiter serves the dish. “Wow! It looks delicious!” Says Taohong excitedly. Look at her appearance, her eye closes like a line, and she shakes her head. There also is a dimple on her face.

Mingyue and Lingxiao see the Taohong is enchanted, then they smell it. 

“Well, it’s very delicious!” Says Lingxiao.

“Well, me too, it’s really delicious.” Mingyue think that’s good.

“I, oh no, shall we start to have the meal?” Taohong is looking at the lemon duck excitedly, and she is slobber unnoticedly. (Lingxiao Inner OS: It seems that when one wants to please Taohong, just need a large meal!) (Mingyue Inner OS: Only a large meal can get Taohong? How easy?!)

“OK, let’s have the meal!” Lingxiao is excited, too.

Then they start to eat their meal.
