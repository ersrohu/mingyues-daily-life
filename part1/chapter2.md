# Chapter 2

At the morning of the next day, Mingyue go to the drink shop near the community and buy a glass of lemon tea. Today is weekend, so Mingyue take the phone and order a takeout. (Inner OS of Mingyue : That’s very good!)

Then he comes to his room, open his laptop and open Minecraft.

“Ding, dong.” the doorbell breaks his gametime.

“That’s good and just I’m hungry now, it came on time very much!”

“Gentleman, here is your takeout.”

“Um, well, you delivered to here very fast.”

“Don’t forget to give us Five-star praise.”

“Of course.”

“Thanks. I’ve to go now.”

“Um, bye!”

Mingyue ate the takeout quickly, then he looked at the news and to play games.

“Dong, dong, dong”, Mingyue exit the game and go to open the door.

“Hello neighbour, what’s the matter?”

“I want to go out for a period, can you take care of my baby?”

“Of course, I can.”
