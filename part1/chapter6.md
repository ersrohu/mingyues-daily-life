# Chapter 6

Two days later, Mingyue phones to Lingxiao.

“Hey, Lingxiao, tomorrow is Taohong’s birthday!”

“Um, I know it. However, what do you want to tell me?”

“I, um, nothing. Just… Um, nothing.”

Suddenly, Mingyue seems think something, then he phones Lingxiao again.

“Hey Lingxiao, where does Taohong live?”

“Ah? Why do you want to ask this?”

“Well, nothing, I just want to ask it.” (Lingxiao Inner OS: Ah, it may not be nothing, it seems that he wants to get Taohong with something. However, what does he want to present Taohong?)

“At Room 1002, Block 7, Guicheng Housing Estate, No.17, Furong Road.”

“Are you at it with her?”

“No, I am not. I’m eating rice noodles then I’ll go back soon.”

“Toot…” the phone hangs up.

After the phone hangs up, Mingyue drive his Hongqi H9 luxury car and go to the 4S shop at West Loop Road.

“Ah, gentleman, welcome!” When Mingyue come in, the waitress rush to him hospitality.

“Ah? Just for waiting me?” Mingyue has a lot of questions.

“Yes, there is only one Haval F7X SUV.”

“Really?” Mingyue doesn’t believe it.

“Or else?” The waitress seems want to make formality.

“Yeah!” Mingyue go to make formality at reception excitedly.

“That… can I change the address?” Asked Mingyue.

“I want to change to near Guicheng Estate, No.17, Furong Road, OK?”

“It seems OK, let me look.”

(Three minutes later)

“I found it, is it here?”

“Yes. Can you deliver the car to there at half past nine at tomorrow night?”

“Of course!” Answered waitress confidently.
