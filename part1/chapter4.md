# Chapter 4

!> **Warning**: There are a lot of swear words, do you really want to read this?

When Mingyue went back Xitai, it only was four days later.

“It’s very different when I went to survey them.”

It turned out that when Mingyue was surveying the working condition at the branch…

“Hey, who are you?” asked Xie Xun (the director of this branch) with domineeringness.

“I’m the surveyor from Xitai. On the order of superiors, I come here and survey your working condition.”

“Surveyor? I think that you come here and find fault!” said Xie Xun domineeringly. (“His working attitude looks ‘very good’!” thought Mingyue.)

Mingyue was not very unhappy, just when he was thinking, he wrote something on the registration book.

Suddenly, Xie Xun walked to Mingyue and snatched his registration book. He said, “You dare record? Did I let you record? Who are you did you think? You dare to make trouble here? You ate bear heart and leopard gall? I tell you that anyone can’t make trouble here! I tell you that my brother is the manager here, don’t make trouble here!”

It seems that Mingyue didn’t care it very much, however, he said casually, “OK, I go to have my meal.” Then he got out.

“Have meal? I think that you want to eat the shit!” Xie Xun said, “Fuck off!” (Mingyue Inner OS: Ah…) Then Xie Xun kicked to Mingyue.

Mingyue didn’t say anything, just get out from office silently and go into the elevator.

“Hey, don’t go, I don’t play enough! Come here and continue, aren’t you so strong? Come here, continue…” “Dong…” The elevator closed its door. It seems that Mingyue didn’t hear anything when Xie Xun was swearing.

Mingyue went out from elevator, then he took a taxi and go to hotel had his meal and sleep.

Later, Mingyue go back to Xitai, he didn’t stay more time in Xiaoyun. Because Mingyue think that he didn’t need to survey them, and the director is not good now. (Mingyue Inner OS: I must convene staff first! They’re still good, at least their original intention is good.)
